**OpenCode Observability** turns the session history OpenCode already writes to disk into a fast, local dashboard. It runs a single monitor server on your machine, reads OpenCode's session store **read-only**, and streams live activity into a browser UI. Nothing is sent to the cloud — there is no account, no external endpoint, and no data ever leaves `localhost`.

> **OpenCode is the focus.** The live monitor and dashboard are built around OpenCode. Because the session viewer happens to be harness-agnostic, **Claude Code** and **Codex** sessions can be browsed in the same UI too — a bonus, not the main event.

```bash
npx opencode-observability
# → open http://127.0.0.1:3737
```

## ✨ Features

- 🛰️ **Live Monitor** — every open OpenCode session as a card with an inline real-time timeline (last 5 minutes), so you can spot a stuck agent, a retry storm, or an error the moment it happens.
- 📊 **Dashboard** — token consumption, model performance, MCP usage, error patterns, subagent trends, and an activity heatmap across your OpenCode sessions.
- 🔍 **Session Viewer** — replay any past conversation with full Markdown rendering, [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) syntax highlighting (17 languages), and live Mermaid diagrams.
- 🔌 **Zero-setup plugin** — the OpenCode plugin streams live events and auto-starts the monitor, so there's no server to babysit.
- 🔒 **Local by design** — read-only access to your existing session store, a metadata-only live boundary, and no raw payloads exposed to the browser.
- ➕ **Bonus — Claude Code & Codex** — the same viewer also opens Claude Code and Codex sessions, each with a `/monitor` command handled by a hook **before the model runs** (zero token cost).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Requires **Node.js ≥ 22**.

```bash
# Run the monitor with no install
npx opencode-observability

# …or install globally
npm install -g opencode-observability
opencode-observability
```

The server starts at **http://127.0.0.1:3737** and opens on the live **Monitor**. It immediately reads whatever OpenCode history already exists on your machine — no configuration required.

## 🧩 Integrations

### OpenCode

Add the plugin to your OpenCode config (`opencode.json` or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-observability"]
}
```

The plugin streams live session events and heartbeats to the monitor. If the monitor isn't running yet and the ingest target is local, the plugin **auto-starts a single shared server** with a lock — so multiple OpenCode processes share one monitor instead of spawning duplicates.

### Bonus: Claude Code & Codex

OpenCode is the focus, but since the viewer is harness-agnostic this repo also ships marketplace plugins that add a monitor command to Claude Code (`/oc:monitor`) and Codex (`@monitor`), opening the **current** session in the viewer. Each hook runs **before the model**, so it costs **zero tokens**.

**Claude Code**

```text
/plugin marketplace add abekdwight/opencode-observability
/plugin install oc@opencode-observability
```

**Codex**

```text
codex plugin marketplace add abekdwight/opencode-observability
codex plugin add opencode-observability@opencode-observability
```

Run `/oc:monitor` in Claude Code (Codex uses `/monitor` or the `@monitor` skill). Plugin hooks need a one-time trust approval on first use. Starting with plugin version **0.3.1**, the installed hook is only a thin launcher; it delegates monitor behavior to `npx --yes opencode-observability@latest hook <codex|claude>`, so future hook behavior ships through the npm package. If the local viewer server is not running, the npm CLI starts one in the background with `npx --yes opencode-observability@latest`.

Existing plugin installs from before **0.3.1** need one manual update so the thin launcher is installed:

```text
# Codex
codex plugin marketplace upgrade opencode-observability
codex plugin add opencode-observability@opencode-observability

# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace update opencode-observability
claude plugin uninstall opencode-observability
claude plugin install oc@opencode-observability
```

After that, restart the host app and re-approve the hook if prompted.

## 🗺️ What's Inside

| Page | Route | Scope | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Monitor** | `/monitor` | OpenCode | Live cards for every open session with an inline activity timeline. Real-time, in-memory only. |
| **Dashboard** | `/dashboard` | OpenCode | Aggregated metrics: tokens, models, MCP usage, errors, subagents, and activity heatmap. |
| **Search** | `/search` | OpenCode | Search across session content. |
| **Sessions** | `/sessions` | OpenCode · Claude Code · Codex | Browse and open historical sessions across every detected harness. |
| **Session Detail** | `/sessions/:harness/:id` | OpenCode · Claude Code · Codex | Full conversation replay with Markdown, syntax highlighting, and Mermaid diagrams. |

**Timeline lanes** on the Monitor stack activity by operator-facing category, so degradation is visible at a glance:

🩶 `activity` — status/updates · 🔵 `subagent` — subagent launches · 🟠 `pressure` — compaction, retries, warnings · 🔴 `failure` — errors needing intervention

## ⚙️ Configuration

Every option has a sensible default — the table below is for tuning. Copy `.env.example` to get started.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3737` | Server listen port. |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Server listen host. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_PATH` | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | OpenCode session database. |
| `CODEX_STATE_DB_PATH` | `~/.codex/state_5.sqlite` | Codex state database. |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR` | `~/.claude/projects` | Claude Code session transcripts. |
| `OPENCODE_MONITOR_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS` | `90000` | Grace period before an idle source is dropped. |
| `OPENCODE_MONITOR_INGEST_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | If set, ingest requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. |
| `OPENCODE_OBSERVABILITY_AUTOSTART` | `1` | Let OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex plugins auto-start the local monitor. Set `0` to disable. |
| `OPENCODE_OBSERVABILITY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3737` | Viewer base URL used by the Claude Code / Codex hooks. |
| `OPENCODE_OBSERVABILITY_AUTOSTART_TIMEOUT_MS` | `20000` | Maximum time Claude Code / Codex hooks wait for an auto-started viewer server. |
| `OPENCODE_OBSERVABILITY_HOOK_CMD` | _(unset)_ | Override the thin hook launcher command before the harness arg. Intended for development/testing. |

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

### OpenCode / Codex history is empty

If the **Sessions** page lists Claude Code sessions but **OpenCode and Codex are missing** (`source: missing-database`), your OpenCode plugin cache is probably holding a broken **0.1.0** build. OpenCode caches plugins under a `@latest` directory and reuses it, so simply restarting OpenCode does not always pull the fix.

Clear the cached plugin and restart OpenCode so it re-fetches the latest version:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/opencode/packages/opencode-observability@latest
```

Versions **0.1.1 and later** use Node's built-in `node:sqlite` instead of a native module, so there is no install-time build step that OpenCode's script-less install could skip — once you are on 0.1.1+, this cannot recur.

## 🏗️ Architecture

    OC --> D1["opencode.db"]
    D1 -- "read-only" --> SRV

    end
    D2 -. "read-only" .-> SRV
    D3 -. "read-only" .-> SRV
```

The **live Monitor**, **Dashboard**, and **Search** are driven entirely by OpenCode — the plugin's ingest stream plus a read-only connection to `opencode.db`. The **session viewer** additionally reads Claude Code and Codex stores through a harness-adapter layer that normalizes all three formats behind one contract, so the UI never depends on a vendor's raw shape.

```text
src/
├─ server/         Hono read-only API, ingest aggregator, app-shell delivery
├─ services/       Aggregation, view models, and per-harness adapters
│  └─ harness/     opencode · claude · codex adapters
├─ repositories/   SQL access
├─ contracts/      Browser-facing data contracts
└─ lib/            Config, db, formatting
web/               React + Vite app shell (Tailwind, Radix UI, Recharts)
```

**Stack:** TypeScript · [Hono](https://hono.dev) · [React 19](https://react.dev) + [Vite](https://vite.dev) · [`node:sqlite`](https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html) · [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) · [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) · [Shiki](https://shiki.style) · [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) · [Recharts](https://recharts.org).

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

- **Local only.** The server binds to `127.0.0.1` and reads your existing session stores read-only. No telemetry leaves your machine.
- **Metadata boundary.** Live timeline events carry only metadata (status, category, level, counts) — never message bodies, prompts, tool arguments, or stack traces.
- **No raw payloads.** Browser-facing contracts never expose raw upstream data.
- **Safe rendering.** Markdown is rendered without raw HTML; diffs are escaped.
- **Guarded deletes.** Destructive actions are re-validated server-side against a confirmation header.

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev        # build the app shell, then start the server with hot reload
npm run build      # production build (server + app)
npm run lint       # Biome + plugin release checks
npm run typecheck  # tsc
npm run test       # Vitest
npm run test:e2e   # Playwright
```

Plugin manifest versions are owned by `semantic-release`: the release job syncs
both Codex and Claude Code manifests to `nextRelease.version`, commits them with
the npm package version, and fast-forwards `develop` so marketplace installs see
the latest released plugin version. Ordinary PRs should not manually bump plugin
manifest versions unless they are correcting an already released state.
